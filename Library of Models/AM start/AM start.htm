  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Asynchronous Motor Start</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4px;">This simulation model illustrates direct-on-line (DOL) start of the asynchronous motor (AM) the rated power and voltage of which are 2 MW and 10 kV, respectively. Single line diagram of the model is given in the next figure. As illustrated in the figure, the AM is initially disconnected from the grid, and a start event <img src="event_motor_start.bmp" alt="AM start event"> is defined to initiate its connection. The event connects AM to the grid at t=0.3 s.</p>

<p>The waveforms of AM active power and rotor speed are shown in the next figure. AM is started initially loaded by active power of 0.5 MW.</p>

  <p>Free acceleration (no-load) characteristic of AM is given in the next figure. Compared to the previosu figure, the acceleration characteristic is similair, but the acceleration time is shorter.</p>

  <p>Simulation diagrams that show waveforms of electromagnetic torque and rotor speed of 2250 hp AM from the book "Analysis of Electric Machinery and Drive Systems" (Authors: Paul Krause, Oleg Wasynczuk, Scott Sudhoff, and Steven Pekarek; Third Edition) are given in the next figure. Note: Waveform of the electromagnetic torgue (Te) is very much comparable to active power waveform. Obviously, the simulation results of the induction motor’s free acceleration obtained with CASE are qualitatively consistent with those presented in the book.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: center";>CASE Implementation</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Calculation of open conductor faults has been implemented in CASE as static calculation, like short circuits. CASE supports calculation of open conductor faults on lines, transformers, generators, and loads. By clicking "Open Conductors" button in the ribbon, the dialog window for calculation of open conductor faults is lunched. There are four tabs in the dialog, each for one type of power system element. When lines are selected, the distance between the first and second line node must be specified as a percentage (in this case, 40%), as illustrated in the next figure. This indicates that the parameters of the line from the first node to the fault correspond to 40% of the total line parameters.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 2. Launching open conductor faults module.</p>
  <p>Since all three cases for open conductor fault are selected for calculation (1 phase open (PO) = TRUE, 2 PO = TRUE, 3 PO = TRUE), clicking button "Calculate" results of calculation for all three cases are printed in "Convergence and Results" window, as shown in the next figure. Conductor has two broken ends at the fault location, denoted as <i>p</i> and <i>p'</i> in the Fig. 1. CASE outputs the following at the fault location: voltages between the broken ends (Vpp′a(b)(c)), phase voltages on each side of the broken line (Vpa(b)(c) and Vp′a(b)(c)), and line voltages on each side of the broken line (Vpab(c) and Vp′ab(c)).</p>
