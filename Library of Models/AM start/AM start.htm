  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Asynchronous Motor Start</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4px;">This simulation model illustrates direct-on-line (DOL) start of the asynchronous motor (AM) the rated power and voltage of which are 2 MW and 10 kV, respectively. Single line diagram of the model with results of power flow calculation is given in the next figure. As illustrated in the figure, the AM is initially disconnected from the grid, and a start event <img src="event_motor_start.bmp" alt="AM start event"> is defined to initiate its connection at t=0.3 s. Note: system events are graphical objects in CASE. As shown in the next figure, short circuit on the "Node 1" - "Node 2" line is greyed, which means this event is disabled.</p>

  <p>CASE supports both single and double cage induction motor models. Double-cage induction motors are constructed in order to boost machine starting torque. Next figures show single and double cage induction motor start.</p>
   <h3 style="text-align: center;">Single-Cage Motor Start</h3>
<p>The waveforms of AM active power and rotor speed are shown in the next figure. AM is started started under an initial load of 0.5 MW. It takes approximately 2 seconds for AM to reach steady state. It is worth noting that high-power AMs have low rotor resistance (0.5%-1%) and, consequently, low starting torque. That's the reason why it takes several seconds to reach steady state. </p>

  <p>Free acceleration (no-load) characteristic of AM is given in the next figure. Compared to the previous figure, the acceleration characteristic is almost identical, but the acceleration time is shorter - unloaded AM takes approximately 1.6 seconds to reach steady state.</p>

  <p>Simulation diagrams that show waveforms of electromagnetic torque and rotor speed of 2250 hp AM from the book "Analysis of Electric Machinery and Drive Systems" (Authors: Paul Krause, Oleg Wasynczuk, Scott Sudhoff, and Steven Pekarek; Third Edition) are given in the next figure. Note: Waveform of the electromagnetic torgue (Te) is very much comparable to active power waveform. Obviously, the simulation results of the induction motor’s free acceleration obtained with CASE are qualitatively consistent with those presented in the book.</p>

   <h3 style="text-align: center;">Double-Cage Motor Start</h3>
  <p>In order to convert AM model from single-cage to double-cage, user needs to double click AM in the SLD, which launches machine dialog window, and in tab "Transient Stability" check option "Double Cage". Edit boxes for entering rotor outer cage parameters Rr2 and Xr2 will be enabled. Rr2 is usually 4 times higher than Rr1, whereas Xr2 is commonly 4 times lower than Xr1. We can specify Rr2=3.6% and and Xr2=2%. Start of double-cage AM with such parameters is shown in the next figure. </p>
