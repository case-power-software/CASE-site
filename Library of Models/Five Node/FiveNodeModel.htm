  <h2>Five Node Model</h2>
  <p>The model contains five nodes, two synchronous salient-pole (hydro) generators the rated voltage of which is 10 kV, three lines, two transformers, and single composite load. The composite load comprises three components: 1) constant power - 90 MW and 30 Mvar, 2) constant impedance - 30 MW and 10 Mvar, and 3) constant current - 30 MW and 10 Mvar. One of the generators is system swing machine. Single line diagram with power flow calculation results is given in the next figure.</p>

  <p>For transient stability calculation, three phase short circuit is simulated on the one of the lines between nodes <b>Node 1</b> and <b>Node 2</b>. Fault occurs at t=1 s and is cleared at t=1.15 s by disconnecting the faulted line.</p>
