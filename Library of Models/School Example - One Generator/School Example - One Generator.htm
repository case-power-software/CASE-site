  <h2>School Example - One Generator</h2>
  <p><b>Objective:</b> Simulation of synchronous machine rotor angle and active power in case of three-phase short circuit in electrical vicinity.</p>
  <p>The model contains two nodes, one generator the rated voltage of which is 110 kV (there is no generator the rated voltage of which is 110 kV in reality), two lines, and external system which is used to model stiff power grid. Single line diagram with power flow calculation results is given in the next figure.</p>

  <p>For transient stability calculation, three phase short circuit is simulated on the one of the lines between nodes <b>Node 1</b> and <b>External</b>. Fault happens at t=1 s and is cleared at t=1.15 s by disconnecting faulted line.</p>
