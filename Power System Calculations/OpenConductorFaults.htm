  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Open Conductor Faults</h2>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Theoretical Review</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Open conductor faults are series faults in a power system where one, two or even all three conductors of a power system element are disconnected, creating new unbalanced or balanced system state. It is a series fault unlike short circuits, which are shunt faults. The next figure illustrates all three cases:</p>
<ol style="spaced">
<li>phase "a" is broken, </li>
<li>phases "b" and "c" are broken, and</li> 
<li>all three phases are broken</li> 
</ol>
<p>As shown in the figure, the conductor(s) of the line between nodes "m" and "n" are broken at location "p".</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;>CASE Implementation</h3>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Regular</b> or <b>Full</b> - LU decomposition of Jacobian matrix is performed at each iteration.</li>
  <li><b>Modified</b> - LU decomposition of Jacobian matrix is performed only at initial iteration.</li>
  <li><b>Combined</b> - LU decomposition of Jacobian matrix is performed only at the initial iteration and at subsequent iterations in which convergence rate drops below a specified threshold. This method is a combination of the previous two and represents the optimal balance of calculation speed and accuracy.
