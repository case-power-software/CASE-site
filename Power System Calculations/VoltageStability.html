  <h2>Voltage Stability</h2>
  <p>Small–signal voltage stability calculation is rarely or almost not carried out at all in long term plans and studies of power system development. On of results of this stability calculation is estimation of consumption maximum power at particular node. It is point at which active power at so called P–V curve has a maximum value. This point and entire P–V curve are determined by software using load flow calculation which is carried out for many cases whereby in each subsequent case power consumption of analyzed node or group of nodes is increased by a certain value.</p>
