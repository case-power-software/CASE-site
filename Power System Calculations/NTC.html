  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Net Transfer Capacity</h1>
  <p>The Total Transfer Capacity (TTC) is the maximum exchange programme between two areas compatible with operational security standards applicable at each system if future network conditions, generation and load patterns were perfectly known in advance.TTC is always related to a given power system scenario, i.e.: generation schedule, consumption pattern and available network that constitute the data allowing to build up a mathematical model of the power system (power flow equations).</p>
<p> The Transmission Reliability Margin (TRM) is a security margin that copes with uncertainties on the computed TTC values arising from:<br>
a) Unintended deviations of physical flows during operation due to the physical functioning of load-frequency regulation;<br>
b) Emergency exchanges between TSOs to cope with unexpected unbalanced situations in real time; <br>
c) Inaccuracies, e. g. in data collection and measurements.</p>
<p>The Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) is the maximum exchange programme between two areas compatible with security standards applicable in both areas and taking into account the technical uncertainties on future network conditions. NTC is defined as:<br>
  <strong>NTC = TTC - TRM</strong></p>
  <p>Details about implementation of CASE NTC calculation are available in the program help.</p>
