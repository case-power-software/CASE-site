  <h1>Network Reduction</h1>
  <p>Network reduction is relatively straightforward function based on the power flow results, i.e. power flow calculation has to be carried out before the function is used. The user selects particular area(s) or all of them and certain voltages levels within the selected areas that are to be eliminated. CASE deletes all nodes, lines, and transformers that are connected to selected voltage levels in selected areas and introduces loads equal to power flows through the eliminated transformers. The network reduction dialog window is shown in the following figure.</p>
