  <h2>Small-Signal Stability</h2>
  <p>Small-signal stability, which is also called static stability or modal analysis, deals with system stability in case of small disturbances such as consumption and production variations on hourly and daily basis. Advantage of this type of analysis is its global character because it provides all system state matrix eigenvalues, i.e. system poles, within single system calculation. Existence of single system pole with positive real part indicates unstable system.</p>
