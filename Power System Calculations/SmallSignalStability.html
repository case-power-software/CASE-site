  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Small-Signal Stability</h2>
  <p>Small-signal stability (SSS), which is also called static stability or modal analysis, deals with system stability in case of small disturbances such as consumption and production variations on hourly and daily basis. Advantage of this type of analysis is its global character because it provides all system state matrix eigenvalues, i.e. system poles, within single system calculation. Existence of single system pole with positive real part indicates unstable system.</p>
  <p>Besides eigenvalues, CASE calculates eigenvectors (left and right), and participation factors. In addition, participation factors of each eigenvalue are sorted in descending order and associated with the corresponding generator. CASE plots eigenvalues as shown in the figure below. Green <span style="color: green;">X</span> is used to denote stable poles whereas red <span style="color: red;">X</span> is used to denote unstable ones.</p>
