  <p>Short circuit calculation is a system calculation used for equipment dimensioning and protection adjustment. There are two types of short circuit calculation:<br></p>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Complete</b> - Results of load flow calcultion, i.e. calculated voltages, are taken into account.</li>
  <li><b>Flat</b> - All node voltages are assumed to be 1.0 pu. The method is widely used and follows IEC 60909‑0.</li>
  </ol>
