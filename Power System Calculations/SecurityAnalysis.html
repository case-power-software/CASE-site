  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Security Analyses</h1>
  <p>Security analyses are essential when planning the development of the transmission system. Most transmission grid codes define compliance with the N‑1 security criterion as mandatory. In addition to N‑1 analysis, investigation of the broader N‑X security criterion is occasionally carried out.</p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">N-1 Security Analysis</h2>
  <p>This type of security analysis encompasses investigation of N-1 security criterion which means power flows are calculated in many cases, defined by the user, where single branch, line or transformer, is out of service. Most often, power flows are calculated for the unavailability of each power grid branch recording overloads of available branches and violations of voltage limits at particular nodes.</p>
  <p> N-1 security analysis dialog is shown in the following figure. Power flow calculations are performed in a separate thread, and the user may interrupt the analysis at any time.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">N-X Security Analysis</h2>
  <p>This type of security analysis encompasses scenarios involving simultaneous instantaneous unavailabilities of lines, transformers, and generators. Dialog window for N-X security analysis is shown in the next figure. There are 3 scenarious (cases) created. Second scenario, as shown in the firuge, contains 4 elements unavailable: one line, one transformer, and two generators.</p>
