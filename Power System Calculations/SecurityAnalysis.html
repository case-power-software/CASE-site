  <h1>Security Analyses</h1>
  <p>Security analyses include investigation of N-1 and N-X security criteria. </p>
  <h2>N-1 Security Analysis</h2>
  <p>This type of security analysis encompasses investigation of N-1 security criterion which means power flows are calculated in many cases, defined by the user, where single branch, line or transformer, is out of service. Most often, power flows are calculated for the unavailability of each power grid branch recording overloads of available branches and violations of voltage limits at particular nodes.</p>
  <p> The network reduction dialog window is shown in the following figure.<div style="text-align: center;">

<p>It should be noted that, after network reduction, the power flows in the remaining grid elements remain unchanged. On the other side, grid losses are reduced.</p>
